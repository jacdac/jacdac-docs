Jacdac modules have one more hardware components, represented by one or more Jacdac [services](/services),
as well as one or more Jacdac [edge connectors](/start/edgeconnectors) to allow them to be connected
to other modules, [brains](/start/brains), or [jacdaptors](/start/jacdaptors). We see 
modules above, made by three different manufacturers:

-   the [Keycap Button](/devices/kittenbot/keycapbuttonv10/) is a **user input** module that hosts a button (and two edge connectors), represented by the [button](/services/button) service;
-   the [pH Sensor](/devices/forward-education/phsensorv10) is a **sensor** module that hosts a pH (acidity) sensor, represented by the [acidity](/services/acidity√ü) service
-   the [RGB Ring](/devices/elecfreaks/jacdacledring8v10/) is a **user output** module hosting eight RGB LEDs, represented by the [LED](/service/led) service

Modules include actuators as well as sensors, user input, and user output.
