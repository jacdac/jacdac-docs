Jacdac can provide a convenient way to add functionality to existing electronics prototyping platforms via _Jacdaptors_. As shown above, the current set of Jacdaptors includes:
- [KittenBot's Jacdaptor](/devices/kittenbot/jacdaptorformicrobitv2v10) for the [micro:bit V2](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/), programmable via [MakeCode](/clients/makecode)
- [Forward Education's Breakout Board](/devices/forward-education/breakoutboardrelaypumpv10/) for the micro:bit V2 includes a LiPo battery and an array of Jacdac ports;
- [iCShop's display shield](/devices/icshop/gamebitexpansionboardv10.json) for the micro:bit V2 features a color display, LiPo battery and two Jacdac ports.

In the above cases, the Jacaptor bridges the Jacdac bus to an existing programmable device (brain).
