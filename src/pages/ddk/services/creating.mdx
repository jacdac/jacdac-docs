title: Creating a New Services
---


* **New mixin service**. Maybe you have a new type of temperature sensor, but you find that
the [temperature service](/services/temperature/) doesn't have all the features
that you would like to expose to your end users. In this case, the preferred path forward is 
to use the temperature service *and* provide an additional *mixin* service for the extra
features of your sensor.

* **New top-level service**. On the other hand, perhaps you have a need for a completely
new top-level service. 

In either of the above cases, you should:
- copy and edit an [existing](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac/tree/main/services)
  service specification in the [service editor](/tools/service-editor/)
- submit a pull request (PR), using the service editor
- after PR is merged, [implement the service firmware](#implementing-service-firmware)
See the [service language specification](/reference/service-specification/) 
for more details about the syntax and semantics of services. 

## Implementing service firmware

If you need to implement a new service, we again recommend that you start with an existing service
implementation, as found in the [services directory](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services)
of the jacdac-c repo:
* [services/servo.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/servo.c) has a simple example of registers
* [services/buzzer.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/buzzer.c) has a simple example of how a command is handled (in `buzzer_handle_packet()`)
* [services/thermometer.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/thermometer.c) is a very simple sensor
* [services/power.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/power.c) is a more involved sensor (with custom registers)

Once you add a service, make sure to add its `*_init()` function to 
[services/jd_services.h](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/jd_services.h).

The Jacdac runtime contains a set of helper functions for working with the
components of a Jacdac service: registers, commands, and events.
