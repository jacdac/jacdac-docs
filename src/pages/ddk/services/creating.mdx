title: Creating a Jacdac Service
---

To create a service, please start as follows: 
- copy and edit an [existing](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac/tree/main/services)
  service specification in the [service editor](/tools/service-editor/)
- submit a pull request (PR), using the service editor
See the [service language specification](/reference/service-specification/) 
for more details about the syntax and semantics of services. 

We will use the [button service](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac/tree/main/services/button.md)
as a running example.

Once your PR has been merged, the following set of assets will be automatically created
for your service:
- a set of TypeScript definitions for your service in the file, including the following
  - a definition of the service class number (`SRV_BUTTON`)
  - enums for all the service members, including registers, commands and events  
- a C include file ([button.h](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac/blob/main/dist/c/button.h))
- a MakeCode extension providing a service client ([pxt-jacdac/button](https://github.com/jacdac/pxt-jacdac/tree/master/button))

The other required assets that need to be created for the service include:
- a TypeScript server written against the [JDOM](/clients/javascript)
- a React component based on the TypeScript server, which will support both device twins and simulators
- firmware for a server in C using [jacdac-c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c)
- tests for the service, written using the TypeScript test framework

We will add code generation for more assets soon.

## A TypeScript server

- a server in TypeScript using the [JDOM](/clients/javascript)

## React-based component (device twin and simulator)

## Tests

## MakeCode Client

# Firmware for server

If you need to implement a new service, we again recommend that you start with an existing service
implementation, as found in the [services directory](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services)
of the jacdac-c repo:
* [services/servo.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/servo.c) has a simple example of registers
* [services/buzzer.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/buzzer.c) has a simple example of how a command is handled (in `buzzer_handle_packet()`)
* [services/thermometer.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/thermometer.c) is a very simple sensor
* [services/power.c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/power.c) is a more involved sensor (with custom registers)

Once you add a service, make sure to add its `*_init()` function to 
[services/jd_services.h](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services/jd_services.h).

The Jacdac runtime contains a set of helper functions for working with the
components of a Jacdac service: registers, commands, and events.
