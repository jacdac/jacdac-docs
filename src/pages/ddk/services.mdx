# Service Definition

Jacdac modules must run an instance of the [control service](/services/control) in order to
advertise themselves, as well as the services they support, on the Jacdac bus. A platform-independent
[control service implementation](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/blob/main/source/jd_control.c) 
is part of the [jacdac-c firmware repo](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c). The basic flow of service 
creation and implementation breaks into four steps, detailed below.

## Finding a service specification

When designing a new device, please first check the [service catalog](/services) to see if there is
a service that already meets your needs.  If you've found one, then check the
[services folder](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services) of the jacdac-c repo
(or in [jacdac-padauk](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-padauk/tree/main/services) when using that MCU)
to see if there is already an implementation available for that service. 

## Creating a new service specification

If you haven't found a service that exactly meets your needs, there are two basic 
paths forward: 

* **New mixin service**. Maybe you have a new type of temperature sensor, but you find that
the [temperature service](/services/temperature/) doesn't have all the features
that you would like to expose to your end users. In this case, the preferred path forward is 
to use the temperature service *and* provide an additional *mixin* service for the extra
features of your sensor.

* **New top-level service**. On the other hand, perhaps you have a need for a completely
new top-level service. 

In both cases, refer to the [service creation tutorial](/ddk/services/service-creation/).
