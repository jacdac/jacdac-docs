# Service Definition

Jacdac modules must run an instance of the [control service](/services/control) in order to
advertise themselves, as well as the services they support, on the Jacdac bus. A platform-independent
[control service implementation](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/blob/main/source/jd_control.c) 
is part of the [jacdac-c firmware repo](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c). The basic flow of service 
creation and implementation breaks into four steps, detailed below.

# Finding a service specification

When designing a new device, please first check the [service catalog](/services) to see if there is
a service that already meets your needs.  If you've found one, then check the
[services folder](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c/tree/main/services) of the jacdac-c repo
(or in [jacdac-padauk](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-padauk/tree/main/services) when using that MCU)
to see if there is already an implementation available for that service. 

# Creating a service specification

If you haven't found a service that exactly meets your needs, you 
will need to [create a new service](/ddk/services/creating). 
This requires designing a service specification and developing
the following five assets in support of the service: 
- a server in TypeScript using the [JDOM](/clients/javascript)
- a React component based on the TypeScript server, which will support both device twins and simulators
- firmware for a server in C using [jacdac-c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c)
- tests for the service, written using the TypeScript test framework
- a MakeCode client for the service
That said, there are code generators to help you get started.
