## Device labelling

All devices should include silkscreen that allows a user to easily identify the name of the device, its manufacturer, and its version number. This way a user can be absolutely sure about the identity of any device.

Devices may optionally include a QR code printed on the silkscreen. WEe suggested that the QR code encapsulate a  *short url* so that it requires fewer blocks to encode, meaning that when it's printed on the PCB silkscreen it will still work well. The QR code should ultimately redirect to the device's entry in the the [Jacdac device catalog](/devices/).

To generate the QR Code for various electronics CAD applications, you can use the [Jacdac Device QR Code generator](/tools/device-qr-code/).

## Device form factor

We recommend using the [EC30 form factor](../ec30) for Jacdac devices. This standardizes the size and shape of Jacdac devices along with the position of key elements such as the Jacdac connector(s) and status LEDs.
