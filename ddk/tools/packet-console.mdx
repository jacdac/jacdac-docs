# Packet Console

The **packet console** provides a low-level log view over the packets being sent and received for the protocol.
This is an advanced view for a user trying to understand how the communication is hapenning (or not) in the protocol.

## Exploring packets

-   Open the [device tree](./device-tree) and click on the **history** icon to open the console
-   Use filters to narrow down which packet to see
